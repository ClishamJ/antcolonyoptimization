# antcolonyoptimization

> [Ant colony optimization (ACO), introduced by Dorigo in his doctoral dissertation, is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony. ACO is a probabilistic technique useful in problems that deal with finding better paths through graphs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence#Ant_colony_optimization_.28Dorigo_1992.29)

## Getting Started

This implementation of ACO solves the graph coloring problem, and offers a variety of options in regards to the tests performed.

### Prerequisites

This implementation of ACO requires the Python ["curses"](https://docs.python.org/2/library/curses.html) library.

This Python library is only included by default on Linux and Mac. As explained in the official Python documentation:

> [The Windows version of Python doesn’t include the curses module. A ported version called UniCurses is available. You could also try the Console module written by Fredrik Lundh, which doesn’t use the same API as curses but provides cursor-addressable text output and full support for mouse and keyboard input.](https://docs.python.org/3.4/howto/curses.html)
